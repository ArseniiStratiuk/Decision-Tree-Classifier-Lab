# Tree Algorithms and Decision Tree Classifier Lab

## Overview

**Team 5, Arsenii Stratiuk, Viktor Syrotiuk**

This repository contains a student lab project focused on implementing and analyzing fundamental tree algorithms and a Decision Tree classifier. The project is divided into two main tasks:

1. **Task 1: Graph Algorithm Analysis**  
   - Implementation and comparison of **Kruskal's** and **Prim's** algorithms for Minimum Spanning Trees (MST).  
   - Analysis of **Bellman-Ford** and **Floyd-Warshall** algorithms for shortest path detection in graphs.  
   - Time complexity measurements and performance plots for varying graph sizes.

2. **Task 2: Decision Tree Classifier**  
   - A custom Decision Tree classifier built from scratch using Gini impurity.  
   - Validation on the Iris dataset, with comparisons to scikit-learn's implementation.  
   - Visualization of tree structures and accuracy evaluation.

## Features

- Random graph generation with adjustable completeness and weights.  
- MST algorithms (Kruskal/Prim) and shortest path algorithms (Bellman-Ford/Floyd-Warshall).  
- Decision Tree classifier with training, prediction, and evaluation.  
- Integration with `networkx`, `scikit-learn`, and `graphviz` for visualization.
